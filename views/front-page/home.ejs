                Mother having blind children were suffering a lot while searching for kindergarten teaching center for their blind children in Addis Ababa. Since the service was not available in Addis Ababa and even in Ethiopia, We planned to establish an organization with the aim of opening kindergarten for blind children. Hence Vision parentsâ€™ of blind children was established and licensed as a local, non-profit, charity organization on March 15,2022. We are also working on protection of the rights of children.
